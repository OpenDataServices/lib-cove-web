  <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
  <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site.</p>

  <p>Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>

  <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>

  <p>In this website we use cookies to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Help us analyse how our website is used."</li>
    <li>To ensure other sites can’t “forge” requests.</li>
    <li>Remember your choices within the application, for your convenience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We use <a href="http://matomo.org">Matomo</a> to analyse usage of our website (see "Understanding website visitor and traffic patterns" section below). This uses cookies to identify you (anonymously) as the same user, so that we can analyse our web traffic better. E.g. it allows us to count how many users we have, instead of just total page views or analyse what pages people commonly visit together.</p>

  <p>If you do allow cookies to be used, Matomo uses 1st party cookies, set on the domain of this website. Cookies created by Matomo start with: </p>

  <p>See: <a href="http://piwik.org/faq/general/faq_146/">http://piwik.org/faq/general/faq_146/</a> for more information.</p>

  <p>The application is built using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and we use that framework to set the following cookies:</p>
   <ul>{% comment %}Translators: csrftoken and sessionid are names of cookies and do not need translation {% endcomment %}
    <li>csrftoken - (to prevent cross site scripting attacks https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/csrf/#how-it-works)</li>

  <h3>Understanding website visitor and traffic patterns</h3>
  We collect data about your visits to the website, for the purpose of analysing how the website is used, so that we can improve it. A self hosted copy of Matomo is used for this.

    <li>Referrer (what page you arrived at one of our web pages from)</li>

  </ul>We do not use this data to personally identify individuals, but it is possible that it could be used to do so, particularly if combined with other datasets.</p>

  <p>You can opt out of this processing:
  If you have set your web browser to "I do not want to be tracked" (DoNotTrack is enabled) then Matomo will not track your visit.</p>

  <p>Matomo also it’s own opt out mechanism:</p>
